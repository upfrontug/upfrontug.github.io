<h1>Speakers Guide</h1>

<p>
  Dear speaker,
</p>

<p>
  We’re happy you’d like to give a talk at up.front.ug! Our meetup is focused on web design and frontend development topics. Every month we meet at <a href="http://co-up.de" title="co-up.de">co.up</a>, a co-working space in Kreuzberg, where we regularly attract a crowd of 70 people or more – usually a diverse mix of designers, frontend developers, concept, UX and communications people, and more. Our events are free and open for everyone.
</p>

<h3 id="information">Talk Requirements</h3>

<h5>Duration</h5>
<p>
  Talks should be no longer than 15-20 minutes. Please make absolutely sure to keep your talk within this limit! Up.front aims to present short, focused ideas, and is not the right format for a 40 minute presentation. The audience will thank you for not stretching the evening after a long workday, and so will the other speakers and the team. We’ll provide a countdown so you can check your timing during the talk.
</p>

<h5>Language</h5>
<p>
  Talks at up.front are in English.
</p>

<h5>Questions</h5>
<p>
  We do not take questions from the audience after talks. There’ll be time for discussion during breaks and after the meetup.
</p>

<h5>Code of Conduct</h5>
<p>
  Please review our <a href="http://up.front.ug/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>. We aim to be a safe and inclusive event, and encourage you to use inclusive language and imagery in your presentation, for example by <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Nonsexist_language">avoiding gendered pronouns</a>. Please reach out anytime if you have questions.
</p>

You can project your screen either via AirPlay (Mac OS X >= 10.8) or the HDMI/VGA ports of the projector. We have a set of adapters to MiniDisplayPort (for MacBooks), but if you want to be on the safe side or your machine supports neither VGA, HDMI or MiniDisplayPort, feel free to bring your own.
