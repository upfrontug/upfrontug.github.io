<h1>Speakers Guide</h1>

<p>
  Dear speaker,
</p>

<p>
  We’re happy you’d like to give a talk at up.front.ug! Our meetup is focused on web design and frontend development topics. Every month we meet at <a href="http://co-up.de" title="co-up.de">co.up</a>, a co-working space in Kreuzberg, where we regularly attract a crowd of 70 people or more – usually a diverse mix of designers, frontend developers, concept, UX and communications people, and more. Our events are free and open for everyone.
</p>

<h3 id="information">Your Talk and Required Information</h3>

<p>
  Talks should be no longer than 20 minutes. We’ll provide a countdown so you can check your timing during the talk. We do not take questions from the audience – there’ll be time for discussion at the end of the meetup.
</p>
<p>
  Please provide us with the following information so we can announce your talk <!--(and if you are familiar with HTML, please use <a href="https://gist.github.com/Kriesse/6762161">this template</a>)-->, also make sure that your abstract and bio are written as third person statements (e.g. <i>"In this talk Laura will talk about…"</i> instead of <i>"In this talk I will talk about…"</i>):
</p>

<ul class="talk-list">

   <li class="talk_example">
     <h4><span>Your Name:</span> Title of your talk</h4>
     <p>
       Short abstract (3-5 sentences) of your talk, e.g.: What is your main question? What is your hypothesis? What will people learn? If it is a technical talk: What is the level (beginner, advanced, expert) and what knowledge is needed to be able to follow along (e.g. HTML, CSS)?
     </p>
     <p class="talk__bio">
       A sentence about yourself, what you are working on or whatever you want to let people know about yourself. Please phrase your bio as third person statements (e.g. "Sara is a UX reseacher and loves pancakes").
