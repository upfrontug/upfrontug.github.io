_Melanie is a co-founder and lead web developer at Little Web Giants, where she builds all sorts of web projects, from e-commerce to CRM integrations to data visualisations. She also is an active member of the Berlin tech community, speaker, front end web development teacher, and holds degrees in Creative Computing in Political Science from the University of Melbourne. Melanie has had a lifelong involvement with volunteer and activist work on issues of social justice and the environment.

__Hi Melanie! Thanks for taking the time to answer some questions for us. How did you get to where you are now? I know you’ve studied Computer Science but also something entirely different before?__

I’ve had a pretty meandering path to where I am now. When I finished high school I wanted to be a painter, and studied visual arts for six months before dropping out. The next year I went back to university and studied history and politics, finishing up with a pretty intense period studying and working with Indigenous people and environmental activists.

I’d kept painting through the degree though, and was keen to move to Berlin because I’d heard the art and music scene was amazing. So I studied to be an English as a Second Language teacher and did that while I saved up to move to Europe.
Unfortunately by the time I got to Berlin I was pretty burned out from teaching and was looking to do something new. I was doing some marketing work for my Dad’s company, and ended up getting more and more involved with running their website. Over time I fell in love with coding and started to get freelance web development jobs.
It was only then that I went back and studied Computer Science through Goldsmiths College in London. It’s a really interesting program at Goldsmiths because it combines creative thinking and practice with programming skills – although it’s not always directly relevant to my day to day work.

__Can you think of a web project, or an app, or a creative project that recently impressed and inspired you?__

The projects that really blow me away generally combine some sort of journalism or storytelling with really great interactive data visualisations. I remember a couple of years ago when I discovered The Guardian datablog, I was just so inspired – here were people with a strong social justice mission, doing really fascinating, stylish and compelling web projects that balanced storytelling and sharing the data and facts.
Of course this whole field has blossomed incredibly in the past few years. One brilliant example I saw earlier in the year looked at the overall trends of deaths in wars over the twentieth century. It’s a dark topic but ultimately it carried a hopeful message.
Another lovely example I saw recently was an animated web version of Nam Le’s beautiful short story The Boat, which tells the story of a group of Vietnamese refugees struggling to reach Australia.

__Do you remember your first design or front end project? Is it still online?__

My first freelance gig came about because I literally started telling people at parties I could build them a website. I had chewed through most of my savings and was pretty stressed about getting a work visa once my work and travel one ran out.
Karra Duchi is an American cellist who’d also just moved to Berlin – I made a website to promote her as a performer and a teacher. I must have spent hours upon hours working on it, and earned about €200. But it was an important step for my portfolio and for my self-confidence, and Karra wrote a lovely referral letter for the Ausländerbehörde!
The website is very much a product of its time (circa 2010). I think I threw every design trope of the era at it – overlaid partly transparent images (thanks to no more IE6!), real world textures, large background images, and of course it was well before the days of subtlepatterns.com, Google fonts, or me being able to afford decent illustration assets! And all hacked together in a Wordpress theme.
But I still like the logo, which was the first thing I ever made in Illustrator, and I’m proud that I wrote my first ever WP Query on that site, without even really knowing what a database was. It’s still online too.

__What do you like about giving talks?__

I think the best thing about giving talks is that it forces you to collect all of your knowledge on a particular topic and set it down in one place. It really exposes the gaps that you might have been fudging over in your work and forces you to go and complete them. Once you’ve done that, it’s there as a reference for yourself and your colleagues, as well as your audience.
You also need to think about how to communicate that knowledge – and that’s about paring it down to the absolutely essential concepts that can be shared in 20 minutes or so. It helps you focus on what’s important.
Of course I also really enjoy the social aspects, it’s a great way to meet new people, and I also just like getting up on stage and performing.


__What are your best practices to learn something new?__

I’ve never really been one for starting with the theory. Usually I have either a brief from a client or an idea I want to realize for myself. So I like to dive into a big or challenging project and just have a go. Generally I’ll make use of a lot of copy and paste, tweaking other people’s example code, things like that.
Once I’ve got my hands dirty for a bit, I might go back and read some more higher level theory. For example, I’ve done a fair bit of work this year building games or interactive installations of different kinds. One of the big challenges in building games is managing state – am I in a menu screen or in gameplay right now? If gameplay, which level am I in? I found that there were really well established design patterns to solve these problems – regardless of whether you are programming in Javascript or C or whatever.
I think at that stage the theoretical ideas slot into your practical experience, and at that point you can refactor your work – or just start a new project!
