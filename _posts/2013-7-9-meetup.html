intro: >
  It&#x2019;s the summer edition of up.front! In the summer, many of us try to
  take some time off and maybe reflect on the things we do. We would like to pick
  up on that theme, with two personal talks, aimed to help us define ourselves as
  professionals, freelancers, designers or developers, and maybe as humans.

talks:
  - title: Always be Building
    name: Sven Ellingen
    description: 'Sven loves to start things. And then grow them. Ideas, things, projects, products, teams. And lately: a company &#x2014; after 5 years at Edenspiekermann, he decided to start from scratch, on his own. This talk is about leaving something great behind to make room for something that&#x2019;s even better. It&#x2019;s essentially about the beauty of building things.'
    bio: 'Sven is a designer bridging disciplines across business, design, and technology. Co-founder of @acolorbright. Previously: Creative Director at @edenspiekermann.'

  - title: "Embracing what you're not"
    name: Kilian McMahon
    description: 'Kilian has spent the last couple of years fumbling around as a designer trying to figure out how to become the people he admired but to no avail. This talk is about getting away from the idea of fitting yourself to others, recognising that you don&apos;t work like everyone else and understanding that being different is so much better.'
    bio: 'Kilian is a designer from Dublin who works on a ticketing app called Tito and a conference called &#xDA;ll.'
