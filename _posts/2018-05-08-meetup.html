    desc: 'Belief in conspiracy theories, such as the idea that climate change is a hoax, suppresses a person’s feelings of autonomy and willingness to act—they’re resigned to impotency in the face of forces they deem more powerful than themselves. Now, social media is spreading suspicious thinking with user-specific filters and social exclusion, as well as exposure to increasingly extreme conspiracy content via recommendation algorithms. With an issue as pressing as climate change, we cannot afford inaction. This talk asks: how can we overcome ‘post-truth’ culture and create empowered individuals for climate action?'
    bio: 'Christine works with social media, communications, and data at Climate-KIC, Europe’s leading climate innovation initiative. In her spare time, she dabbles in digital media theory.'

    title: 'How to become a more focused, empathic, healthier, beautiful and better paid creative in only 1 step'
    picture: 'kai-niephaus.jpg'
    desc: 'Analysing, and drawing parallels between the publishing trend, classic marketing, universalized process disfavor and common sense – this talk explores possibilities on how to take advantage of the everyday creative discomfort. Nonseriousness may occur.'
    bio: 'Kai-Uwe is a Berlin based user experience designer and strategist with a focus on digital-products and integrated communication. He can only use his powers for good.'
