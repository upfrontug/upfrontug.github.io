      title: 'Pragmatic Webfont Strategies'
      picture:
      desc: 'Webfonts, in theory, are great. Using them responsibly though, without negative impact on the user experience, is an engineering nightmare at best, impossible at worst. In this talk I will look at different typographic scenarios on the Web and discuss solutions for selecting and loading webfonts responsibly.'
      bio: 'Frederic Marx is a code-driven designer with a background in media and cultural studies. He gets excited about typography, design systems, tools and the nature of the Web as an interconnected social platform. He also coaches at CSSclasses and loves co-learning and exchanging knowledge with inclusive communities.'
