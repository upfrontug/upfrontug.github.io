  - title: 'Skeumorphic Mess vs the Boring Flatlands: What’s a “Digitally Native User Interface”?'
    name: ''
    description: >-
      Over the past years, we&#x2019;ve witnessed a constant debate about
      competing trends in our field: Mimicking real world objects in user
      interfaces versus a revived flat approach, which the proponents label as
      more content-focused, <i>digitally native</i> and even <i>honest</i>.

          <br>

      It&#x2019;s time to put this into perspective. Is there more to this new
      flat trend than just a different level of polish and angry designer youth
      re-discovering modernism? How can a user interface be native and honest in
      the first place?

          <br>



      We&#x2019;ll look at different approaches and whether they&#x2019;re
      relevant. To get a broader contexts of terms used in the discussion,
      we&#x2019;ll not only discuss interaction design and usability, but also
      will have a look at art history and architecture.
