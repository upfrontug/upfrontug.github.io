talks:
  - title: 'Performance Matters: Mobile Websites'
    name: Burak Son
    description: 'Have you ever thought whether users have smooth and fast experience on your mobile website? This talk aims to shed light on the factors that affect bad user experience on mobile web products. It will also guide you through how to get the best out of countless devices and platforms. The talk briefly covers the main practices for performance optimization in front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) as well as generic tips that need to be taken into account.'
    bio: 'Burak is a front-end developer, currently working at Sociomantic Labs in Berlin. He enjoys working on standalone client-side development with different technologies and environments.'

  - title: Design Thinking from the Trenches - Introducing Phased Design Sprints into Scrum
    name: Allard van Helbergen

    description: 'How can you ensure that you are making informed design decisions and aren&#x2019;t wasting time on building the wrong thing? How can you maximise the decision making power that UX Design has? For all the jargon flying around regarding Agile Processes, Scrum Methodologies and Lean UX, there is surprisingly little guidance available on what it means to bring Design Thinking and User Centered Design into your daily grind when working on an established app. Building off of existing concepts, Allard proposes tweaking the workflow that UX Designers have in a Scrum team so as to maximise the impact that design has for the product.'
    bio: 'Allard is a UX Designer at Brandwatch, ex-Googler, frontend afficionado and general process geek. As an avid wind-/kite-/snow-/skate-/everythingboarder he loves the rush of adrenaline as well as watching cartoons on Sunday morning with a bowl of cereals.'
