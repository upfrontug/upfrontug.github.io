  Up.front 59 is coming up – join us on July 14th for the last meetup before the summer break! We’ll keep it short and sweet with only two talks, so there’ll be plenty of time to enjoy the weather with some drinks and discussions afterwards. But be prepared for some serious thought food brought to you by Lukas Rieder who will introduce you to visualisations and D3, and Gilberto Urutea who's going to explore complex systems.

    <h4><span>Lukas Rieder:</span> Object Constancy In Visualisations</h4>
    <p>
      Visualisations are the backbone of data driven story telling. In between the many ways to represent data nowadays, lies one fundamental principle of our perception to make visualisations comprehensible. The talk aims to dive into the idea behind object constancy and shows how D3.js can help you achieve this goal. Even if you are new to D3, this talk will have you covered.
