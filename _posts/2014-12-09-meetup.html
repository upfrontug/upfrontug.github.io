    <h4><span>David Owens:</span> The Virtues of Cities and How to Rebuild Them</h4>
    <p>
      The earliest human settlements were founded, and grew, thanks to the benefits of shared resources and communal ways of working. After the industrial revolution city growth exploded to produce the global megacities we are familiar with today.
      <br>
These megacities are often missing the personal relationships that were the reasons for their original founding. Cities have grown to serve the global economy before their citizens.
      <br>
Connected cities and the sharing economy point to ways that we can recover some of those lost benefits of city living. How can we as designers and developers contribute to sustainable, livable and social cities?

    <h4><span>Hany Rizk:</span> Is UX Killing the Experience?</h4>
    <p>
      Testing and optimisation techniques have become ubiquitous and common to a point where almost any use case or UI or UX element has become standardised with best practices and design guidelines. This leads to products having similar look-and-feels with no uniqueness or sense of identity at all.
      <br>
      How can a product be designed with a strong identity to stand out among its competitors, while at the same time appeasing to best practices in UX and conversion?
