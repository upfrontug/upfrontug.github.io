  - title: The Virtues of Cities and How to Rebuild Them
    name: David Owens
    description: >-
      The earliest human settlements were founded, and grew, thanks to the
      benefits of shared resources and communal ways of working. After the
      industrial revolution city growth exploded to produce the global megacities
      we are familiar with today.

            <br>

      These megacities are often missing the personal relationships that were the
      reasons for their original founding. Cities have grown to serve the global
      economy before their citizens.

            <br>

      Connected cities and the sharing economy point to ways that we can recover
      some of those lost benefits of city living. How can we as designers and
      developers contribute to sustainable, livable and social cities?

  - title: Is UX Killing the Experience?
    name: Hany Rizk
    description: >-
      Testing and optimisation techniques have become ubiquitous and common to
      a point where almost any use case or UI or UX element has become
      standardised with best practices and design guidelines. This leads to
      products having similar look-and-feels with no uniqueness or sense of
      identity at all.

            <br>

            How can a product be designed with a strong identity to stand out
      among its competitors, while at the same time appeasing to best practices
      in UX and conversion?
    bio: 'A UX person through and through, Hany has been working and actively involved in the UX scene for over three years now. After receiving a Master&#x2019;s degree in Human-Computer Interaction from Uppsala University in Sweden, Hany began focusing on UX &amp; product strategy on which he&#x2019;s given numerous talks at different conferences and events in Germany, Sweden and Lebanon. He is also on the organizing committee of EuroIA.'
