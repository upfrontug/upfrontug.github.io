    <h4><span>Mariusz Ciesla:</span>Making animations make sense</h4>

      Judging by the number of animated GIFs on Dribbble, we can probably all tell that fancy animations and transitions are all the rage in interaction design. How do we make sure they add to the experience, rather than being a fancy distraction, though?</p>
    <p class="speaker_info">
      Mariusz is a designer, developer and co-founder of <a href="http://www.lifetramp.com">Lifetramp.com</a>. He’s a big fan of both animations and good user experience, which led him to running a Gibbon playlist about designing meaningful UI animations. Really bad at maintaining balance on a skateboard.

    <h4><span>Bastian Albers:</span>Why Gestures Suck in HTML5 (and why not so much anymore)</h4>

    We are used to fancy touch interfaces of native apps by now. You can do a lot if not almost all of that gesture goodness in the browser as well, but it's a kind of screwed up competition. "the browser" is a million things. Let me walk you through some technical basics and ideas of what you can do and how. And how to always have a fallback, as we're still building for the web.
