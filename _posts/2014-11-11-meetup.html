talks:
  - title: Making animations make sense
    name: Mariusz Ciesla
    video: //www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C3bKoKxCSg4
    description: 'Judging by the number of animated GIFs on Dribbble, we can probably all tell that fancy animations and transitions are all the rage in interaction design. How do we make sure they add to the experience, rather than being a fancy distraction, though?'
    bio: 'Mariusz is a designer, developer and co-founder of <a href="http://www.lifetramp.com">Lifetramp.com</a>. He&#x2019;s a big fan of both animations and good user experience, which led him to running a Gibbon playlist about designing meaningful UI animations. Really bad at maintaining balance on a skateboard.'

  - title: Why Gestures Suck in HTML5 (and why not so much anymore)
    name: Bastian Albers
    video: //www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S2ZCpFGCuek
    description: 'We are used to fancy touch interfaces of native apps by now. You can do a lot if not almost all of that gesture goodness in the browser as well, but it&apos;s a kind of screwed up competition. &quot;the browser&quot; is a million things. Let me walk you through some technical basics and ideas of what you can do and how. And how to always have a fallback, as we&apos;re still building for the web.'
    bio: 'Bastian is a web developer and consultant from Berlin and often found teaching workshops at <a href="http://www.opentechschool.org/">OpenTechSchool</a>.'
