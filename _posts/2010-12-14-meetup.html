intro: >
  On December 14 we are going to gather for a special Christmas edition of our
  meet-up. Let&#x2019;s enjoy some mulled wine, munch cookies and hear
  a lightning talk or two. If you want to share a cool new tool, technology or
  case that fits into the web design frontend category in a lightning talk
  (~5min), you are very welcome to share it with us.

    <br>

    We would also like to plan the next meet-ups with you! Which topics do you
  want to discuss or would you like to be discussed? Do you think theme nights
  like the last one make sense or would you rather go for mixed evenings, etc.

    This is also a great chance to give us feedback about past events.

    <br>

    PS: Baked some tasty cookies? Bring &#x2019;em! :-)
