    Sass + mathematics. Many web developers nowadays use CSS preprocessors, and do simple calculations like ($a + $b) * $c in them. But we can do more. Much more: sin, cos, tan, … and calculate square roots like the ancient Babylonians. A short trip into geometry. Bring your rulers and compasses!
    </p>
    <p class="speaker_info">
      As a frontend developer on the whatever-first path, Gunnar aims at a better understanding between humans and machines. He helps organizing the World Usability Day Berlin and struggles not to forget how to play the guitar.
