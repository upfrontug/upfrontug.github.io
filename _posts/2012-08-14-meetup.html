  - title: Self / Digital Self
    name: Christoph Rauscher
    description: 'Is our digital identity different from our analog one? The digital lifestyle is somehow changing our view on ourselves, and we have to cope with these transformations. Is that me inside this machine, or is it just a distorted portrayal? How do I reflect myself when there are different versions of me online? For his bachelor thesis, Christoph wants to explore how philosophy and self-reflection are connected to interaction design.'
    bio: 'Christoph Rauscher is a designer and illustrator who enjoys creative itching, cyborgism and terrestrial mammals.'
