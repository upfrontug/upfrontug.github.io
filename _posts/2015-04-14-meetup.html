  - title: 'Brand Holism: How A Brand Becomes A Living Organism'
    name: Emanuel Jochum
    description: 'We live in a dynamic and highly digitalized world. The development in culture, technology and economy leads to new forms of how we connect with each other, how we communicate and how we use products and services. What does this increasing flexibility mean for a brand? Why must a brand not fight against change, but needs to be an active part of it? How does a brand become a living organism?'
    bio: 'Emanuel is an Austrian cosmopolitan and communication designer based in Berlin. He is passionate about holistic branding, social entrepreneurship, wonderful beaches and Mexican food. Currently he helps impact-driven start-ups and small businesses to shape their vision and identity, and does research on strategic brand leadership from a design perspective.'

  - title: Getting More Women In Open Source
    name: Anika Lindtner
    description: >-
      This talk is a bit of a magic trick. It will solve a problem that seems
      pretty unsolvable right now: Getting more women in tech. We&#x2019;ve all
      heard of more and more women leaving the tech industry. What&#x2019;s
      happening? How did we get here? What can we do?<br>

              Anika will tell you a true story about 33 women from all over the
      world: directors, photographers, PR manager, linguists and many more that
      wrote Open Source code for 3 months. It&#x2019;s a story about role models,
      community - and cat gifs. With the women focussed scholarship program Rails
      Girls Summer of Code we are writing history in Open Source and she will
      tell you how it&#x2019;s done. How to raise $80k, how to build a community
      based project, that will keep on going and how to change 33 lives.<br>

              With this talk we will go on a short adventure in the tech jungle
      and see what we can achieve as a community and where we are failing. How we
      can get more women in Open Source, instead of losing them.<br>

              And why the f*ck we should care.
    bio: >-
      Anika Lindtner was born and raised in Berlin. Since July 2013 she works at
      Travis CI and runs the Travis Foundation, aiming to make Open Source even
      better. She manages Rails Girls Summer of Code - a three months scholarship
      program in Open Source - and helps over 30 women each year to change their
      lives.<br>

              Anika once was a poetry slam artist, a teacher and worked at an ad
      agency. She can also draw monsters, knit hats with pom poms and likes urban
      gardening.
