    name: Martin Spindler
    description: 'Computers are getting ever cheaper, smaller and more energy efficient. This leads to an ever-increasing amount of digital hybrids &#x2014; everyday objects equipped with digital capabilities. But this emerging new class of &#x201C;computers&#x201D;, often dubbed the Internet of Things, demands new interfaces that accommodate those new capabilities. What does it mean to design for the Internet of Things, then?'
