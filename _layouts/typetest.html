    <h2>Aller Bold</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 11px;">Forsaking monastic tradition, twelve jovial friars gave up their vocation for a questionable existence on the flying trapeze. The public was amazed to view the quickness and dexterity of the juggler. We quickly seized the black axle and just saved it from going past him. A mad boxer shot a quick, gloved jab to the jaw of his dizzy opponent. Six javelins thrown by the quick savages whizzed forty paces beyond the mark. We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the next prize.</p><span style="font: 80%/1.4 sans-serif; color: #444; display: block;">Paragraph is set for minimum recommended pixel size of 11px</span>
