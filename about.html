  Up.front is a meetup for the web design community. Started in 2010, we are one of the oldest meetups on the topic in Berlin. Up.front was born out of the desire to bring designers and developers together, to start a dialogue between the creative and the technical disciplines of our field. Today our audience is a diverse mix of designers, frontend developers, concept, UX and communications people, and we constantly aim to provide a forum for new voices and inspiring ideas.

<p>
  An evening at up.front features two to four talks that discuss a wide range of topics in the field of web, design, front end development, and everything inbetween. up.front isn’t a traditional usergroup where we discuss one specific language or technology. Instead, we’re interested in topics that aren’t as easily classified, but can maybe be described as "in-depth discourse at the intersections of design and web technology". A few examples of what we’re interested in: Design theory and methods, user experience, storytelling in products, the web design industry and its culture, typography for the web, HTML, CSS, graphics and animations for the web, web performance, professional challenges in design teams … browse our <a href="/archive.html">archive of past events</a> to get an idea of the variety of talks we featured in the past years.

  Up.front actively aims to provide a welcoming and safe space. We enforce a <a href="/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> at our events. We are aware of the lack of diversity in our community, and are committed to encourage and include members of under-represented groups to participate in our events by attending, speaking, or volunteering. We welcome beginners to present and up.front, and offer help and feedback during the talk preparation.
